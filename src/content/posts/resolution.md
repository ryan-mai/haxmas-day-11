# The Dream
It's going to be 2026 in 6 days from when I'm writing. 

And I'm quite sure that 99% of people have not thought about a New Year's goal until last minute. 

Image this scenario: "I'm going to lock in next year and hit the gym! fr fr ong I will imma start going January 1st trust no 🧢!"

<br />

# The Reality
So, what happens the week after? Do you stop? No, you end up pushing yourself for one more week. The thing is, achieving that goal is so hard, that you end up quitting a few weeks later!<br /><br />

It's no surprise, since having goals is useless if it's unachievable. For example, I can say this year, I'm going to launch my first AI B2B SAAS, recieve YC funding, and network to achieve 500+ connections. <br /><br />

The thing is, when we have crazy expectations, ambition, we forget the fact that getting to that point isn't entirely simple. Although my example wasn't entirely great since most of them are just GPT wrappers lol. But my main point is most goals are just utterly unrealistic and you'll end up just quitting. <br /><br />

One key question to ask is: Why didn't I start doing it yesterday? Why do you need to start doing something if you really want to do it. At the end of the day, my thoughts are New Year goals are pretty stupid because if you need an excuse to start then you won't develop the habit in sticking with that goal. <br /><br />

# My Goal
btw my goal for next year is...
